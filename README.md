## Implementation

The app is implemented by using the Python microframework Flask. It is a lightweight app,
in which all the action resides in one file: of_hh.py Flask is only used for development 
and to render all of the website files (Frozen-Flask) completely, which can then be deployed
to any web server. The interactive part then is done at the client side by Javascript thanks 
to the openspending project.
